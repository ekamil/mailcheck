# mailcheckrc	Default configuration for Mailcheck program
#
# This is a sample mailcheckrc file.  It provies a good starting point,
# but it probably isn't exactly what you want.  See mailcheck(1) for
# more information.

# If you edit /etc/login.defs to turn off mailbox checking, you'll
# probably want to enable this next line:
#/var/spool/mail/$(USER)

# If you're using qmail's Maildir feature, you'll probably want to
# enable this line:
#$(HOME)/Maildir/

# For qmail's mbox file in user's home directory:
#$(HOME)/Mailbox
